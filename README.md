Dotfiles for me

## Credits
These dotfiles are based on (https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles/blob/master/macos/defaults.sh)

## Getting started
1. Clone this repository to $HOME/dotfiles
2. run install.sh
3. run :PluginInstall in mvim

##TODO
This repo has big flaws.
Vundle should be a submodule
DIR should not be dependant on being $HOME/dotfiles
Add redis start (redis)[https://medium.com/@petehouston/install-and-config-redis-on-mac-os-x-via-homebrew-eb8df9a4f298]
